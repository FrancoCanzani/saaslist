# The No-BS Product Launch Checklist

I've launched products that flopped. I've launched products that exceeded expectations. The difference usually wasn't the product itself—it was the preparation.

This is the checklist I wish I had for my first launch. No fluff, no "build an email list of 100k people" nonsense. Just the stuff that actually matters.

## Two Weeks Before Launch

### Technical Reality Check

- [ ] **Load test your app.** Seriously. Nothing kills momentum like your site going down when you hit the front page.
- [ ] **Set up error monitoring.** Sentry, LogRocket, whatever. You need to know when things break before your users tell you.
- [ ] **Test your signup flow.** Every. Single. Path. Password reset, email verification, OAuth—all of it.
- [ ] **Prepare for scale.** Even modest success can 10x your traffic. Is your database ready? Your CDN?

### Content You Actually Need

- [ ] **Write your launch copy.** One paragraph describing your product. If you can't do this clearly, your product positioning needs work.
- [ ] **Create screenshots and a demo video.** Under 2 minutes. Show the core value prop, not every feature.
- [ ] **Prepare answers to obvious questions.** Pricing, data security, integrations. You'll get asked these 50 times.

### The Boring Admin Stuff

- [ ] **Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.** Use a template if you must, but have something.
- [ ] **Set up basic analytics.** You need to know where users drop off.
- [ ] **Payment processing is working.** Test transactions. Multiple times. Different cards.

## One Week Before Launch

### Build Your Launch List

- [ ] **Email your existing users.** If you have beta users, tell them launch is coming. Ask them to be ready to support.
- [ ] **Identify 10-20 people who will share.** Not "influencers"—real people who genuinely like your product. Reach out personally.
- [ ] **Prepare your social posts.** Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, whatever fits your audience. Write them now, not launch day.

### Platform Prep

- [ ] **Create your SaasList listing.** Fill out every field. Good screenshots. Honest description.
- [ ] **Queue up other platforms.** Product Hunt, Hacker News, relevant subreddits. Know their rules and best practices.
- [ ] **Prepare a launch email.** For your mailing list. Have it drafted and ready.

### Mental Prep

- [ ] **Set realistic expectations.** 99% of launches don't go viral. Define what success looks like for you.
- [ ] **Plan for the day after.** Launch day is chaos. The real work starts when the traffic normalizes.

## Launch Day

### Morning

- [ ] **Post to your primary platform first.** Give it a few hours before spreading elsewhere.
- [ ] **Monitor comments and questions.** Respond quickly. Be a human, not a marketing bot.
- [ ] **Watch your error logs.** Things will break. Fix them fast.

### Throughout the Day

- [ ] **Share authentically on social.** Tell your story. Why you built this. What it means to you.
- [ ] **Thank people who engage.** Every upvote, every share. Acknowledge them.
- [ ] **Take notes.** What questions are you getting? What confusion exists? This is product feedback gold.

### Do NOT

- [ ] Obsessively refresh the leaderboard
- [ ] Get into arguments with critics
- [ ] Make promises you can't keep
- [ ] Disappear after the initial posts

## The Week After Launch

### Immediate Follow-Up

- [ ] **Email everyone who signed up.** Thank them. Ask what would make the product better for them.
- [ ] **Fix the bugs you discovered.** Prioritize what affects the most users.
- [ ] **Write a launch retrospective.** What worked? What didn't? You'll thank yourself before the next launch.

### Building on Momentum

- [ ] **Reach out to people who engaged.** Turn commenters into customers, or at least advocates.
- [ ] **Update your listing.** Add testimonials, new features, better screenshots.
- [ ] **Plan your next milestone.** What feature or improvement will give you another reason to share?

## The Stuff Nobody Tells You

**Your launch probably won't change everything.** Most successful products are built through consistent work, not viral moments. A good launch is nice. It's not a business strategy.

**The best marketing is a product people want to talk about.** Spend more time making your product better and less time on launch tactics.

**You'll feel terrible at some point.** Launch day anxiety is real. The post-launch depression when traffic dies down is real. It's all normal.

**Nobody cares as much as you do.** And that's fine. Most people will glance at your product for 5 seconds. Design for that reality.

## Quick Reference Card

Print this out. Stick it on your wall.

```
Before launch: Does it work? Can I explain it? Can I handle traffic?
During launch: Be present. Be helpful. Be human.
After launch: Follow up. Fix stuff. Keep building.
```

That's it. Everything else is optimization.
