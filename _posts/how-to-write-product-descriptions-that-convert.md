# How to Write Product Descriptions That Actually Convert

I review hundreds of product submissions. Most descriptions fall into two categories:

1. **Way too vague.** "A revolutionary platform for modern teams." Cool, what does it do?
2. **Way too technical.** "ML-powered API with GraphQL endpoints for real-time data synchronization." Great, but why should I care?

Both miss the point. Here's how to write descriptions that make people click.

## The Formula That Works

After seeing what converts, there's a pattern:

**[What it is] + [Who it's for] + [Main benefit] + [How it's different]**

That's it. You don't need to be clever. You need to be clear.

### Examples

**Bad:** "The future of project management"

**Good:** "A project tracker for freelancers who hate Jira. See your tasks, time spent, and invoices in one screen."

**Bad:** "AI-powered writing assistant"

**Good:** "Grammar checker for non-native English speakers. Fixes errors without dumbing down your writing."

**Bad:** "Next-generation CRM"

**Good:** "A CRM that updates itself. Pulls contact data from email and LinkedIn so you never manually enter a contact again."

## The First Sentence Rule

Your first sentence carries 80% of the weight. Most people won't read past it. This sentence needs to answer: "Is this for me?"

### Test It

Read your first sentence to someone unfamiliar with your product. Ask them:
- What does this product do?
- Who is it for?
- Why would someone want it?

If they can't answer all three, rewrite it.

## Words That Kill Conversions

Some words have become so overused they mean nothing:

- **Revolutionary** — Unless you're actually revolutionizing an industry, cut it
- **Powerful** — Compared to what? Be specific
- **Seamless** — Everything claims to be seamless
- **Best-in-class** — Says who?
- **Robust** — This tells me nothing
- **Leverage** — Just say "use"

Replace these with specifics:

- "Revolutionary project management" → "Project management that shows dependencies visually"
- "Powerful analytics" → "Analytics with 50+ pre-built dashboards"
- "Seamless integration" → "Connects to Slack in 2 clicks"

## The "Mom Test" for Product Descriptions

Explain your product to someone outside your industry. If they get it, you're on the right track. If they start asking clarifying questions, your description needs work.

This doesn't mean dumb it down. It means be precise.

**Too jargony:** "A DAM solution with ML-powered tagging and SSO integration"

**Clearer:** "Organize your company's images, videos, and files in one place. AI tags everything automatically so you can find what you need."

## Show Numbers When You Can

Specific numbers build credibility and paint a picture:

- "Fast" → "Loads in under 200ms"
- "Used by thousands" → "Used by 3,400 teams"
- "Saves time" → "Cuts report creation from 2 hours to 10 minutes"
- "Affordable" → "Starts at $9/month"

## The Social Proof Shortcut

If your product is already being used, mention it:

- "The tool 500 startups use for customer interviews"
- "Replaced Mailchimp for 2,000+ newsletters"
- "Built by ex-Stripe engineers"

This only works if it's true and relevant. Don't force it.

## Format for Scanners

Nobody reads product descriptions word-by-word. They scan. Help them:

**Use short paragraphs.** 2-3 sentences max.

**Lead with the important stuff.** Don't bury the key benefit in paragraph three.

**Use specifics, not superlatives.** "Handles 10,000 concurrent users" beats "incredibly scalable."

## A Quick Template

If you're stuck, try this structure:

```
[Product name] is a [category] for [specific audience].

It helps you [main benefit] by [how it works, briefly].

Unlike [alternative/old way], [Product name] [key differentiator].
```

**Example:**

"Postmark is an email API for developers who care about deliverability.

It helps you send transactional emails that actually reach the inbox by using dedicated IPs and real-time delivery tracking.

Unlike general email services, Postmark only sends transactional emails—no marketing spam mixing with your password resets."

## Before You Publish

Run through this checklist:

- [ ] Can someone understand what you do in one sentence?
- [ ] Is it clear who should use this product?
- [ ] Did you avoid buzzwords and jargon?
- [ ] Is there at least one specific number or detail?
- [ ] Would you click on this if you were your target customer?

Your product description isn't about sounding impressive. It's about helping the right people find you.
